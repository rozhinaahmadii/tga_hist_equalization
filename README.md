## üìù Project Summary

Histogram Equalization is a common technique used to enhance image contrast, especially for low-light or low-contrast conditions. Applications include medical imaging, object detection, and photography.

In this project, we implement and analyze histogram equalization for 24-bit RGB images using CUDA. We compare the CPU baseline with various GPU implementations, including single and multi-GPU strategies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Overview

The equalization process includes the following steps:

1. **RGB to YCbCr** conversion (only the Y channel is equalized)
2. **Histogram calculation** of the Y channel
3. **CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)** computation
4. **Equalization mapping** using the CDF
5. **RGB image reconstruction**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-GPU versions performed worse than single GPU due to overhead, lack of overlapping transfers, and coordination complexity.

## üì¶ How to Run

### 1. Compile with `make` and run the version
```bash
make
./eq_CPU.exe
```
## ‚úÖ Expected Results
You can expect a 40‚Äì60x speedup on large images with the optimized single-GPU versions using shared memory and streams.
The GPU-accelerated versions exclude I/O time in performance metrics. All kernel timings were measured using cudaEventElapsedTime().
