## Project Summary

Histogram Equalization is a technique used to improve the contrast of images, especially those with poor lighting or low definition. It is widely used in medical imaging, object detection, and photography.

In this project, we implement histogram equalization for 24-bit RGB images using CUDA. We explore different strategies to maximize GPU performance.

## Algorithm Overview

The algorithm consists of:

1. Convert RGB to YCbCr (we use only the luminance "Y" channel for equalization).
2. Compute the histogram of Y values (range 0â€“255).
3. Compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF).
4. Use the CDF to map each pixel to an equalized Y value.
5. Reconstruct the image in RGB space.

## CPU vs GPU Implementations

We implemented both CPU and GPU versions:

- `Hist-CPU.cu`: Baseline CPU implementation.
- `Hist-GPU.cu`: CUDA-based version with various optimizations.

In the GPU version, we tested:
- Row-wise, column-wise, and block-wise kernels
- Use of shared memory and pinned memory
- Multi-GPU scalability (1, 2, 4 GPUs)
